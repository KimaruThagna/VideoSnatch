# VideoSnatch
A collection of python scripts that fiddle around with videos. 
Starting with downloading them from youtube, to stripping them and making an audio copy using the library FFMPEG.
The initial script, siphon.py requires you install pytube to run and hence, do pip install pytube.
This project can come in handy for someone wishing to download a list of videos from youtube without switching tabs all the time
between youtube and an online converter.
Next, it shall be modified to cater for bulnk downloads and later, an mp4 to mp3 converter
